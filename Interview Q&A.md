## 🔹 Beginner Mode (10 Questions)

1. **Q:** What is Microsoft Azure?  
   **A:** Azure is a cloud computing platform by Microsoft that provides services such as compute, storage, networking, databases, and AI for building, deploying, and managing applications.

2. **Q:** What are Resource Groups in Azure?  
   **A:** Resource Groups are logical containers in Azure that hold related resources like VMs, storage, and networks to manage them collectively.

3. **Q:** What is a Virtual Network (VNet)?  
   **A:** A VNet is a logically isolated network in Azure where resources like VMs can securely communicate with each other.

4. **Q:** Explain the difference between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.  
   **A:** IaaS provides virtualized infrastructure, PaaS provides platforms to build applications, and SaaS delivers ready-to-use software.

5. **Q:** What is Azure Blob Storage used for?  
   **A:** Blob Storage is used to store unstructured data such as images, videos, logs, and backups.

6. **Q:** What is Azure Active Directory?  
   **A:** Azure AD is a cloud-based identity and access management service that helps secure resources and manage authentication.

7. **Q:** What is the purpose of an Azure Load Balancer?  
   **A:** Load Balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple resources to ensure high availability and reliability.

8. **Q:** Explain Azure Availability Zones.  
   **A:** Availability Zones are physically separate locations within an Azure region that provide redundancy and high availability.

9. **Q:** What is the Azure Marketplace?  
   **A:** Azure Marketplace is an online store with pre-configured apps, services, and templates for easy deployment in Azure.

10. **Q:** What is an Azure Subscription?  
    **A:** A subscription is an agreement with Azure to use resources, track usage, and manage billing.

## 🔹 Intermediate Mode (10 Questions)

1. **Q:** What is Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set?  
   **A:** Scale Sets allow you to deploy and manage a set of identical VMs for scaling applications automatically based on demand.

2. **Q:** Explain Azure Resource Manager (ARM).  
   **A:** ARM is the deployment and management service in Azure that provides a consistent way to create, update, and manage resources.

3. **Q:** What is Azure Key Vault?  
   **A:** Key Vault is a secure service to store and manage secrets, keys, and certificates for applications and services.

4. **Q:** How do you implement Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?  
   **A:** RBAC assigns roles to users, groups, or applications to control their access to Azure resources.

5. **Q:** What is Azure Traffic Manager?  
   **A:** Traffic Manager is a DNS-based load balancer that directs client requests to the most appropriate service endpoint based on routing methods.

6. **Q:** Explain Azure ExpressRoute.  
   **A:** ExpressRoute provides a private, dedicated connection between on-premises infrastructure and Azure, offering better reliability and security than the public internet.

7. **Q:** What is Azure Site Recovery?  
   **A:** Site Recovery ensures business continuity by replicating VMs and enabling failover in case of outages or disasters.

8. **Q:** What are Azure Tags and why are they useful?  
   **A:** Tags are metadata labels applied to resources for organization, cost tracking, and management purposes.

9. **Q:** What is Azure App Service?  
   **A:** App Service is a platform for hosting web apps, REST APIs, and mobile backends with built-in scaling and high availability.

10. **Q:** What are Azure Managed Disks?  
    **A:** Managed Disks are Azure-managed storage for VMs, providing durability, availability, and simplified management.

## 🔹 Advanced Mode (10 Questions)

1. **Q:** How would you design a highly available and cost-optimized architecture in Azure?  
   **A:** Use Availability Zones, Load Balancers, Auto Scaling, Azure SQL with Geo-Replication, and proper monitoring with Azure Monitor to balance cost and resilience.

2. **Q:** Explain Azure Hub-Spoke Network Topology.  
   **A:** The Hub-Spoke model centralizes shared resources in a hub VNet while spokes host application workloads, connected via peering for security and scalability.

3. **Q:** How do you secure multi-tenant applications in Azure?  
   **A:** Implement Azure AD authentication, RBAC, encryption in transit and at rest, network security groups, and application-level security best practices.

4. **Q:** What is Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and how do you use it?  
   **A:** AKS is a managed Kubernetes service to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications, integrating with Azure Monitor and CI/CD pipelines.

5. **Q:** How do you implement disaster recovery and backup strategies in Azure?  
   **A:** Use Azure Site Recovery, geo-redundant storage, regular backups, replication policies, and test failover strategies.

6. **Q:** What is the difference between Azure SQL Database and Managed Instance?  
   **A:** SQL Database is a single database PaaS solution; Managed Instance provides near 100% SQL Server compatibility with instance-level management.

7. **Q:** How do you monitor and optimize Azure resources?  
   **A:** Use Azure Monitor, Application Insights, Log Analytics, cost management, and set up alerts for performance, security, and budget optimization.

8. **Q:** Explain Azure Policy and Blueprints.  
   **A:** Azure Policy enforces rules on resources for compliance; Blueprints provide repeatable deployments of governed resource setups.

9. **Q:** How do you implement a secure hybrid cloud architecture?  
   **A:** Use VPN/ExpressRoute connectivity, Azure AD Connect, conditional access policies, encryption, and secure identity management.

10. **Q:** Describe a Well-Architected Framework in Azure.  
    **A:** The framework includes five pillars—Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, and Operational Excellence—ensuring resilient, scalable, and efficient cloud solutions.
